# Waht is Lists?
# A list is a container where you can store multipe items in a single variable
# Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

# Example of a list
# numers = [1,2,3,4,5]
# fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
# print(numers[1])

# Access By index
# fruits.append("orange")
# fruits.remove("apple")
# print(fruits)

# slicing

# sliced_fruits = fruits[0:1]
# print(sliced_fruits)

# Tuples

# 1 Waht is Tuples
#A tuple is almost like a list, but with one main difference:
# Tuples cannot be changed after they are created (they are immutable).

# colors = ("red","green","blue")
# single_item = ("glass",)
# print(colors)
# print(colors[-1])

# What is Dictionaries

# student = {"name": "jack", "age": 23, "grade": "A"}
# for key, value in student.items():
#     print(key,value)

# student["subject"] = "Math"
# student["age"] = 25
# print(student)
#
# del student["subject"]
# print(student)
#
# student.pop("grade")
# print(student)

# numbers1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
# numbers.add(4)
# numbers.add(10)
# numbers.remove(10)
# print(numbers)

# union Set
# set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
# set2 = {6,7,8,4,10}
# print(set1,set2)
#  # intersection
# print(set1 & set2)
