# Basic Probability Concepts 

# . Sample Sapce andEvents 
# Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes of a rendom expriment
# Events : A subset of the sample space 

    # Conditional Probability 
# . The probability of an event A occurring, given that B has occurred is denoted as P(A|B)

  # independent 
  # Two events A and B are independet if 
    # p(A/B) = P(A) and P(B)
